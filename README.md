The Riemannian conjugate gradient method is a method to calculate ground states of the Kohn-Sham minimization problem, implemented using DFTK.jl. 
This is the implementation from this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16225).

# Getting started

In order to generate the plots from the paper,

    1. choose the respective model, basis in test_molecule.jl,
    2. run test_molecule.jl.

The convergence plots will be displayed after all methods converged.
This readme is a bit short and will be extended in the future.
