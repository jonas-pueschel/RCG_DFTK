The parallel Riemannian conjugate gradient method is a method to calculate ground states of the Kohn-Sham minimization problem. Implemented using DFTK.jl. 

# Getting started

Testing the parallel RCG in DFTK is straight forward:

/*: 
    1. Add dependencies listet in test_molecule.jl
    2. Run test_molecule.jl
*/

TODO: this a bit short, isn't it?
