The Riemannian conjugate gradient method is a method to calculate ground states of the Kohn-Sham minimization problem, Implemented using DFTK.jl. 

# Getting started

Testing the parallel RCG in DFTK is straight forward:

    1. Add dependencies listet in the Manifest
    2. Run test_molecule.jl
    
This readme is a bit short and will be extended in the future.
